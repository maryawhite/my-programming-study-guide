<h1>Do I Need to Know Math to Be a Programmer?</h1>
<p>Yes*, to get through a basic programming course you do need to know some basic math. There are some things you may have learned as a kid that you've
forgotten, or there may be concepts that you memorized without thoroughly understanding the concept. *If you're only interested in design and HTML/CSS then you
might not need to know math.</p>

    <dt>How do you determine if a number is positive or negative?
        <br></dt>
    <dd>This is probably something "you just know", you memorized it as a kid, when you see a negative number, you just know it's negative. From
    a programming perspective, think about it like this: <span class="bluetext">if the number is less than 0 it's negative, if the number
        is greater than 0 it's positive.</span></dd>
    <dt>How do you determine if a number is even or odd?<br></dt>
    <dd>If you're like me, this is another thing you memorized as a kid. I memorized anything that ends in 0,2,4,6, or 8 is even, everything else is odd.
        From
        a programming perspective, think about it like this: <span class="bluetext">if you divide the number by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it's even. If you
        divide the number by 2 and the remainder is 1, then it's odd.</span></dd>
    <dt>How would you find a whole number and a remainder?</dt>
    <dd>Search online for a quick review of Dividend, Divisor, Quotient, and Remainder. </dd>

    <dt>How to find the distance between 2 points?<br></dt>
    <dd>You might not remember this one, I didn't. <br>
        d(A,B) = &radic;(xB - xA) * (xB - xA) + (yB - yA) * (yB - yA). Or, in other words, let's say you have Point A and Point B, to find the distance between the two you would do the square root of x from Point B minus x from Point A times x from Point B minus x from Point A plus y from Point B minus y from Point A times y from Point B minus y from Point A. Which is also the same as the square root of xB minus xA squared plus yB minus yA squared. d(A,B) = &radic;((xB - xA)<sup>2</sup> + (yB - yA)<sup>2</sup>)
        <br>
