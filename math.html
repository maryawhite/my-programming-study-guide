<h1>Do I Need to Know Math to Be a Programmer?</h1>
<p>Yes*, to get through a basic programming course you do need to know some basic math. There are some things you may have learned as a kid that you've
forgotten, or there may be concepts that you memorized without thoroughly understanding the concept. *If you're only interested in design and HTML/CSS then you
might not need to know math.</p>
<h2>What are some basic math things I might have forgotten?</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>How do you determine if a number is positive or negative?
        <br><span class="toggle-link bluetext">toggle</span></dt>
    <dd>This is probably something "you just know", you memorized it as a kid, when you see a negative number, you just know it's negative. From
    a programming perspective, think about it like this: <span class="bluetext">if the number is less than 0 it's negative, if the number
        is greater than 0 it's positive.</span></dd>
    <dt>How do you determine if a number is even or odd?<br><span class="toggle-link bluetext">toggle</span></dt>
    <dd>If you're like me, this is another thing you memorized as a kid. I memorized anything that ends in 0,2,4,6, or 8 is even, everything else is odd.
        From
        a programming perspective, think about it like this: <span class="bluetext">if you divide the number by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it's even. If you
        divide the number by 2 and the remainder is 1, then it's odd.</span></dd>
    <dt>How would you find a whole number and a remainder?</dt>
    <dd></dd>
