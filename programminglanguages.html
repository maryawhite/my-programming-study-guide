<h1>Programming Languages</h1>
        <p>Some examples of programming languages include Java, C# (pronounced C Sharp), JavaScript, and Python. To limit the scope of this study guide, I will be focusing on Java. </p>

        <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>basic syntax</li>
    <li>variable declaration</li>
    <li>data type and structures</li>
    <li>flow control structures (conditionals and loops)</li>
    <li>functional programming</li>
    <li>object-oriented programming</li>
    <li>debugging</li>
    <li>IDEs and coding environments</li>
</ul>

        <h4>Basic Syntax</h4>
        <p>Basic syntax is a broad topic. I would describe basic syntax as the nuances of how the code is written. For example, do you have to end each line with a semicolon, do you need to include parenthesis or curly braces, and what are the
        naming conventions; is the language case-sensitive, do the names of classes and methods start with uppercase or lowercase letters, how are file names formatted, etc.</p>

        <h4>Naming Conventions (in Java)</h4>
        <p>In Java, a Class name begins with a capital letter, if it's two or more words use camelCase (the first word starts with a lowercase letter, each word after begins with uppercase letter). Since classes are objects, they are typically nouns. <code>public class StarPyramid {}</code></p>
        <p>A method in Java begins with a lower case letter, if it's two or more words use camelcase. Method names typically start with a verb since you are performing an action. The purpose of the method should be clear based on the name of the method. <code>public static void drawPyramid() {}</code>
            <br>If you're switching between C# and Java, note that in C# methods begin with a capital letter and use PascalCase (the first letter of every word is capital) </p>
